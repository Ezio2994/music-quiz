# music-quiz

I have created this interactive music quiz as I love music and have always liked to be challenged in my music knowledges.
The game is both single and multiplayer, so you can challenge your friends.
Game built in vanilla javascript and styled and made it responsive in Sass.

## Features:

Playable either in single or multiple players. <br >
Every time the user start a new game, the 10 songs played are going to be generated randomly. <br>
The players get 5 points per every correct answer and lost 5 per every incorrect one. <br>
In the end of every game the players are going to see how many points they totalized and have the option to start a new game.
